# Architecture Documentation

This document captures the technical design decisions, system architecture, and implementation strategies for the chatbot wrapper API project.

## System Overview

The chatbot API is designed as a serverless unified interface for multiple AI model providers using an adapter-based architecture. The system supports OpenAI API, local vLLM models, OpenAI-compatible providers, with planned support for Anthropic and Google models. The application deploys as a serverless architecture on AWS Lambda with Cognito authentication and global edge caching.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Adapter Pattern Implementation
- **Design Choice**: Each model provider has its own adapter implementing a common interface
- **Rationale**: Provides consistent API regardless of underlying provider, enables easy addition of new providers
- **Implementation**: Abstract base class `BaseAdapter` with provider-specific implementations
- **Benefits**: Provider independence, unified response format, easy testing and mocking

### OpenAI Compatibility Strategy
- **Design Choice**: Local vLLM models use OpenAI-compatible endpoints for consistency
- **Rationale**: Minimizes code differences between local and remote providers
- **Implementation**: Single `OpenAIAdapter` handles OpenAI API, vLLM, and compatible providers
- **Benefits**: Reduced complexity, consistent request/response handling, easier migration

### Factory Pattern for Adapter Management
- **Design Choice**: Runtime adapter creation and management through adapter factory
- **Rationale**: Centralized adapter lifecycle management, health monitoring, configuration loading
- **Implementation**: `AdapterFactory` class with provider registration and health checks
- **Benefits**: Dynamic model switching, centralized error handling, consistent initialization

### Configuration Architecture
- **Design Choice**: Environment-based configuration with centralized model registry
- **Rationale**: Single source of truth for model configs, environment-specific deployments
- **Implementation**: Pydantic models in `src/config/models.py` with environment variable overrides
- **Benefits**: Type safety, validation, easy deployment configuration management

## Authentication Strategy

### AWS Cognito Universal SSO Architecture

#### Production Implementation
- **Standards-Based Approach**: OAuth2/OIDC with JWT tokens via AWS Cognito User Pools
- **Serverless Native**: Integrated with API Gateway JWT authorizer for automatic validation
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Support for educational institutions' existing SSO systems
- **Enterprise Ready**: AWS-managed security, scalability, and compliance features

#### Current Cognito Implementation
Production deployment with AWS Cognito User Pools for educational pilot:

**Institution Registry Pattern**:
- Manually curated list of partner institutions with metadata
- Auto-detection based on email domains
- Institution-specific configuration (branding, auth providers, SAML/OIDC settings)

**Institution Configuration Structure**:
```python
# Example from src/auth/cognito_client.py
InstitutionConfig(
    institution_id="example",               # Unique identifier for database
    name="Example University",              # Display name for UI
    domain="example.edu",                   # Email domain for auto-detection
    auth_provider=AuthProvider.GOOGLE,      # Preferred SSO provider (Google/Microsoft/SAML)
    saml_config={...},                     # SAML configuration if applicable
    oidc_config={...},                     # OIDC configuration if applicable
    logo_url="https://example.edu/logo",   # Institution branding for UI
    primary_color="#003366",               # Institution brand color
    enabled=True                           # Whether institution is currently active
)
```

**Authentication Flow Design**:
1. User accesses Cognito Hosted UI (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, SAML providers)
2. API Gateway validates Cognito JWT token automatically
3. System extracts email domain and checks institution registry
4. If institutional email detected: suggest institution and default role
5. If not detected or individual: user selects "Individual" + role
6. Store institution_id and role in user profile
7. Include institution/role in JWT claims for authorization

**Supported Authentication Methods**:
- **Google Workspace**: OAuth integration via Cognito identity providers
- **Microsoft Azure AD/Office 365**: SAML/OIDC integration via Cognito
- **SAML**: Custom enterprise SSO systems via Cognito SAML provider
